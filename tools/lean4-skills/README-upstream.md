## Quick Start

```bash
/lean4:draft               # Draft Lean skeletons from informal claims
/lean4:formalize           # Interactive synthesis (draft + prove)
/lean4:autoformalize       # Autonomous synthesis (source → proof)
/lean4:prove               # Guided sorry filling (interactive)
/lean4:autoprove           # Autonomous sorry filling (unattended)
/lean4:checkpoint          # Build-checked save point
/lean4:review              # Check quality (read-only)
/lean4:refactor            # Simplify proof strategies
/lean4:golf                # Optimize proofs
/lean4:learn               # Explore repo or mathlib
/lean4:doctor              # Diagnostics and migration help
git push                   # Manual, after review
```

This plugin ships a host-agnostic parser (`lib/command_args/`) that covers the
parser-decidable startup rules of the six parameter-heavy commands. The Claude
Code adapter pre-validates `/lean4:*` prompts via a `UserPromptSubmit` hook
that reuses the same parser; other hosts MAY invoke it via
`lib/scripts/parse_command_args.py` but otherwise fall back to model-parsed
startup. Commands must announce resolved inputs, reject invalid startup configs
before doing work, and treat wall-clock budgets as best-effort. See the
[Command Invocation Contract](skills/lean4/references/command-invocation.md).

To run the parser standalone (non-Claude hosts, scripting):

    python3 plugins/lean4/lib/scripts/parse_command_args.py draft -- "topic" --mode=attempt

Exits 0 on success (JSON to stdout), 2 on validation errors (error JSON to stdout).

## How It Works

### Without a Command

When you edit `.lean` files in a normal conversation, the plugin activates automatically — it helps with the immediate issue (a build error, a single sorry) but does one bounded pass only. No looping, no deep escalation. At the end it suggests the right next command:

> Use `/lean4:draft` or `/lean4:formalize` for statement work.
> Use `/lean4:prove` or `/lean4:autoprove` for proof work.

### `/lean4:draft` — Skeleton Drafting

Drafts Lean 4 declaration skeletons from informal claims. Default `--mode=skeleton` produces sorry-stubbed statements; `--mode=attempt` adds a proof-attempt loop. No full proof engine (no cycles, no falsification) — use `/lean4:formalize` for the full pipeline.

### `/lean4:formalize` — Interactive Synthesis

Combines drafting and guided proving in one human-in-the-loop workflow. Drafts a skeleton, then runs prove cycles with user interaction. Owns the right to modify declaration headers (the prove phase itself cannot). Accepts `--source` to ingest papers or files.

### `/lean4:autoformalize` — Autonomous Synthesis

Extracts claims from a source, drafts skeletons, and proves them — all unattended. Replaces the old `autoprove --formalize=auto` workflow as a first-class command with cleaner flag names.

### `/lean4:prove` — Guided Proving

Start here if you're new or want to stay in control.

At startup, `prove` asks your preferences: planning on/off and review source. Before each commit it shows the diff and asks — pick `yes-all` to stop prompting, or `never` to skip all commits for the session. Between every cycle it pauses:

```
Cycle complete. Filled 2/8 sorries this cycle.
- [continue] — run next cycle
- [stop] — save progress and exit
- [adjust] — change flags for next cycle
```

It never auto-starts the next cycle. You decide when to continue.

### `/lean4:autoprove` — Autonomous Proving

Use when you want to kick it off and walk away.

No questionnaire — discovers state and starts immediately. Commits without prompting by default (`--commit=auto`). Loops automatically with checkpoint + review + replan at each cycle boundary. Stops on the first condition met:

- All sorries filled
- 3 consecutive stuck cycles (`--max-stuck-cycles`)
- 20 total cycles (`--max-cycles`)
- 120 minutes wall-clock budget reached (`--max-total-runtime`, checked between cycles)

On stop, emits a structured summary (sorries before/after, cycles, time, handoff recommendations).

### The Cycle Engine (Shared)

Both commands run the same 6-phase cycle:

```
Plan → Work → Checkpoint → Review → Replan → Continue/Stop
```

- **Plan** — Discover sorries via LSP, set order
- **Work** — Per sorry: search mathlib, try tactics, validate, stage only touched files, commit
- **Checkpoint** — Commit cycle progress (skipped if nothing changed)
- **Review** — Scoped quality check at configured intervals (`--review-every`)
- **Replan** — Planner mode updates the action plan based on review findings
- **Continue/Stop** — `prove` asks you; `autoprove` auto-continues

When stuck (same blocker seen twice), both force a review + replan regardless of settings.

### `/lean4:checkpoint` — Save Point

Compiles each touched `.lean` file, runs `lake build`, checks for non-standard axioms, reports sorry count, then stages and commits.

Does **not** push — that's always manual (`git push`).

### `/lean4:review` — Quality Check

Read-only. Does not modify files or create commits.

Runs build verification, sorry audit, axiom check, style review, strategy simplification opportunities, and golfing opportunity scan. Scopes automatically to what you're working on (`--scope=sorry`, `file`, `changed`, or `project`). Two modes:

- **batch** (default) — full report with all sections
- **stuck** — lightweight triage: top 3 blockers with next steps

`prove` and `autoprove` trigger reviews automatically at configured intervals. You can also run `/lean4:review` manually at any time.

### `/lean4:refactor` — Strategy-Level Simplification

Finds better proof approaches: replaces hand-rolled arguments with mathlib lemmas, extracts repeated patterns as helpers, replaces case splits with `congr`/`EqOn` patterns. Asks before each batch of edits; reverts on verification failure. Compiled proofs only.

### `/lean4:golf` — Proof Improvement

Scores candidates by directness → inference burden → performance → length. Applies safe patterns: `by exact t → t`, `apply+exact → exact`, inline single-use `let`, `ext+rfl → rfl`, etc. Conditional patterns (`rw+exact → rwa`) require net score improvement. Verifies with `lean_diagnostic_messages` after each change (`lake build` at final gate only) and reverts failures. Stops when the success rate drops below 20% (saturation).

Usually run after proving, either prompted at the end of a `prove` session or explicitly.

### `/lean4:learn` — Interactive Teaching

Two modes: `--mode=repo` explores your project structure, `--mode=mathlib` navigates mathlib for a topic. Adapts to `--level=beginner|intermediate|expert` and supports `--style=tour|socratic|exercise|game`. Conversational by default; use `--output=scratch` or `--output=file` to write artifacts. For formalization, learn suggests `/lean4:formalize`.

### `/lean4:doctor` — Diagnostics

Checks your environment (lean, lake, python, git), plugin structure, project health, and detects legacy v3 artifacts. Run this first if something isn't working.

### Commit Behavior

- `prove` defaults to `--commit=ask` — prompts before each commit (`yes-all` / `never` to stop prompting)
- `autoprove` defaults to `--commit=auto` — commits without prompting
- Both stage only files actually touched during the work, never `git add -A`

### Safety Guardrails

Guardrails activate only in Lean project context (a directory tree containing `lakefile.lean`, `lean-toolchain`, or `lakefile.toml`). Outside Lean projects, they are silently skipped.

Blocked during Lean project sessions:
- `git push` → Use `/lean4:checkpoint`, then push manually
- `git commit --amend` → Each change is a new commit for safe rollback
- `gh pr create` → Review first with `/lean4:review`
- Destructive git operations (`checkout --`, `restore`, `reset --hard`, `clean -f`) → Commit or checkpoint first
- Deep sorry-filling has snapshot, rollback, scope budgets, and regression gates — see [Cycle Engine](skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#deep-mode)

**Override environment variables:**

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_DISABLE=1` | Skip all guardrails regardless of context |
| `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_FORCE=1` | Enforce guardrails even outside Lean projects |
| `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_COLLAB_POLICY` | Collaboration op policy: `ask` (default), `allow`, `block` |

`LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_DISABLE` overrides everything. `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_FORCE` controls whether guardrails activate outside Lean projects.

**Collaboration policy (`LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_COLLAB_POLICY`):**

Controls how collaboration ops (`git push`, `git commit --amend`, `gh pr create`) are handled:

- **`ask`** (default) — block unless a one-shot bypass token is present. The hook is non-interactive; in `ask` mode the assistant asks you yes/no, then reruns the command with the bypass token once.
- **`allow`** — permit collaboration ops without a bypass token.
- **`block`** — block collaboration ops unconditionally, even with a bypass token.

Invalid values fall back to `ask`. Destructive operations (`checkout --`, `restore`, `reset --hard`, `clean -f`) are always blocked regardless of policy.

**One-shot bypass (collaboration ops only):**

To override a single blocked collaboration command (`git push`, `git commit --amend`, `gh pr create`), prefix it with the bypass token:

```bash
LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_BYPASS=1 git push origin main
```

The token must appear in the leading env-assignment prefix of the command (command prefix only, not an environment variable). Bypass is effective only in `ask` mode (default); it is unnecessary in `allow` mode and ignored in `block` mode. Destructive operations (`checkout --`, `restore`, `reset --hard`, `clean -f`) are always blocked — bypass does not apply to them.

### LSP-First Approach

LSP tools are **normative** (required first-pass), not merely preferred. Both prove and autoprove follow the [LSP-first protocol](skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#lsp-first-protocol):

```
lean_goal(file, line)                           # See exact goal
lean_local_search("keyword")                    # Fast local + mathlib (unlimited)
lean_leanfinder("goal or query")                # Semantic, goal-aware (rate-limited)
lean_leansearch("natural language")             # Semantic search (rate-limited)
lean_loogle("?a → ?b → _")                      # Type-pattern (rate-limited)
lean_multi_attempt(file, line, snippets=[...])  # Test multiple tactics
```

Scripts provide sorry analysis, axiom checking, and search fallback when LSP is unavailable or LSP budget is exhausted. Compiler-guided repair is escalation-only — it triggers when compiler errors resist LSP-first tactics, not on first failure.

## Environment Variables

Set by `bootstrap.sh` at session start:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `LEAN4_PLUGIN_ROOT` | Plugin installation path |
| `LEAN4_SCRIPTS` | Scripts directory |
| `LEAN4_REFS` | References directory |
| `LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN` | Python interpreter |

Optional user overrides (not set by bootstrap):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_DISABLE` | Skip all guardrails (set to `1`) |
| `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_FORCE` | Force guardrails outside Lean projects (set to `1`) |
| `LEAN4_GUARDRAILS_COLLAB_POLICY` | Collaboration op policy: `ask`, `allow`, `block` |

**Script troubleshooting:**
```bash
echo "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS"
ls -l "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/sorry_analyzer.py"
${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/sorry_analyzer.py" . --format=summary --report-only
```

If `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS` is unset, run `/lean4:doctor` to reinitialize.
