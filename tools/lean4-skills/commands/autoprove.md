# Lean4 Autoprove

Autonomous multi-cycle theorem proving. Runs cycles automatically with explicit stop budgets and structured summaries.

## Usage

```
/lean4:autoprove                        # Start autonomous session
/lean4:autoprove File.lean              # Focus on specific file
/lean4:autoprove --repair-only          # Fix build errors without filling sorries
/lean4:autoprove --max-cycles=10        # Limit total cycles
```

## Invocation Contract

Interpret this command's inputs per the
[Command Invocation Contract](../skills/lean4/references/command-invocation.md).

**Primary path (hook-validated):** If a `validated-invocation` block for this
command appears in context, treat it as the authoritative interpretation of
parser-decidable inputs and do **not** re-parse the raw invocation text for
those inputs. Start by reading all parser-decided fields from the block. Emit
the final **Resolved Inputs** summary from the block values.
See [Validated Invocation Block](../skills/lean4/references/command-invocation.md#validated-invocation-block-host-provided).

**Fallback path (other hosts):** If no `validated-invocation` block is present,
parse the raw invocation text against this command's input table before
Phase 1.

Startup requirements:

1. Emit a **Resolved Inputs** block with explicit values, defaults, coercions,
   ignored flags, and startup validation errors.
2. Refuse to start on startup validation errors.
3. Call `bash "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/cycle_tracker.sh" init` with resolved numeric
   values for `--max-cycles`, `--max-stuck-cycles`, `--max-total-runtime`,
   `--max-deep-per-cycle`, and `--max-consecutive-deep-cycles`.
   A failed init (exit 2) is a startup validation error — do not proceed.
4. The state file is the single source of truth for session counters.
   Read counters from `tick`/`status` output, not from conversational memory.

### Review Source Coercion

Autoprove accepts all `--review-source` values for flag compatibility with `/lean4:prove`. However, autoprove **never blocks waiting for interactive input**. If the value is `external` or `both`, autoprove coerces to `internal` at startup and emits:

> ⚠ --review-source=external requires interactive handoff. Using internal review for unattended operation.

> **Future autonomous external review:** External review is currently manual-handoff only. Future versions may support autonomous external review via non-interactive CLI execution (e.g., `codex exec`) behind an explicit opt-in flag (`--external-autonomous`). Until then, unattended autoprove runs default to internal review.
>
> Requirements for autonomous external review:
> 1. Stable JSON input/output contract
> 2. Timeout + retry + cost budgets
> 3. Safe fallback to internal review on external failure
> 4. Explicit opt-in flag, not default behavior

### Formalize Flag Validation

- `--formalize=auto` requires `--source`; error if missing.
- `--formalize=auto` with `--source` requires `--claim-select`; error if missing (no unattended guessing).
- `--formalize=auto` requires `--formalize-out` when no existing target file is in scope; error if missing.
- `--formalize=restage` does NOT require `--source` — operates on existing scope with restage enabled on stuck. `--source` is ignored if provided (warn).
- `--formalize=never` ignores `--source` (warn if provided).
- `--formalize=restage|auto` with default `--statement-policy` coerces `preserve` → `rewrite-generated-only` at startup (warn). Explicit `--statement-policy=preserve` is respected but warns: stuck restage becomes manual intervention, not automatic rewrite.
- `--claim-select` is a queue-extraction filter applied once at startup. Internal draft calls receive individual popped claims, not the full `--source`.
- `--claim-select` without `--source` is ignored (no effect).

## Startup Behavior

No questionnaire. Discover state and start immediately.

1. **Discover state** (LSP-first is **normative**, see [cycle-engine.md](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#lsp-first-protocol)):
   - `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` for errors/warnings
   - `lean_goal(file, line)` at each sorry
   - Up to 3 LSP search tools (~30s); record top candidates per sorry
2. If `--planning=on` (default): run planning phase — list sorries with candidates, set order, then start
3. If `--planning=off`: skip planning, start immediately. Stuck-triggered replan is still mandatory (see Stuck Definition).

## Actions

Each cycle has 6 phases — see [cycle-engine.md](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md) for shared mechanics.

### Phase 1: Plan

See [cycle-engine: LSP-First Protocol](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#lsp-first-protocol). Discover sorries via LSP, search with up to 3 tools (~30s), identify sorries, set order.

### Phase 2: Work (Per Sorry)

See [sorry-filling.md](../skills/lean4/references/sorry-filling.md) and [cycle-engine: LSP-First Protocol](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#lsp-first-protocol).

1. Refresh goal → search → generate 2-3 candidates → test via `lean_multi_attempt`
2. Preflight falsification for decidable/finite goals (30-60s max)
3. Tactic cascade if no candidate passed
4. Validate via `lean_diagnostic_messages`; if "Try this" suggestion appears, resolve with `lean_code_actions`, then re-run `lean_diagnostic_messages` to confirm clean
5. Stage & commit

**Staging rule:** If `--commit=never`, skip staging and committing entirely. Otherwise, stage only the files touched by this fill (`git add <edited files>`) — never `git add -A` or broad patterns. Commit: `git commit -m "fill: [theorem] - [tactic]"`.

**Touched-file reporting:** At session end, report `files_touched` (files edited) and `scratch_files_created` (any `/tmp` files used for experiments).

**Commit behavior** (unique to autoprove):
Default `--commit=auto` — commits without prompting. `--commit=ask` is coerced to `auto` at startup:
> ⚠ --commit=ask requires interactive confirmation. Using auto for unattended operation.

Autoprove never blocks waiting for interactive input.

**Constraints:** Max 3 candidates per sorry, ≤80 lines diff, NO statement changes (inner cycle; see Formalize Outer Loop for `--formalize` modes), NO cross-file refactoring (fast path).

### Phase 3: Checkpoint

See [cycle-engine: Checkpoint Logic](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#checkpoint-logic). Stage only files from successful work; exclude rolled-back deep invocations.

### Phase 4: Review

See [cycle-engine: Review Phase](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#review-phase). Runs at configured `--review-every` intervals.

### Phase 5: Replan

See [cycle-engine: Replan Phase](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#replan-phase).

### Phase 6: Continue / Stop

**Autonomous loop:** Auto-runs cycles without per-cycle user prompts. Checkpoint + review + replan at each cycle boundary ("come up for air").

## Formalize Outer Loop (Deprecated)

> **Deprecated:** Prefer `/lean4:autoformalize` for new workflows. These flags remain functional for compatibility.

When `--formalize` is not `never`, autoprove wraps the inner 6-phase cycle with draft-driven statement acquisition (source-backed for `auto`, scope-backed for `restage`) and review-driven routing.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `never` (default) | No outer loop. Identical to pre-change behavior. |
| `restage` | No claim queue. Run inner cycle on existing scope; on stuck, re-draft if `next_action=redraft` (subject to `--statement-policy`). |
| `auto` | Full loop: extract claims from `--source`, draft each, prove, restage on stuck (subject to `--statement-policy`). |

The inner 6-phase cycle is unchanged. The outer loop reads the stuck-mode `next_action` field from review as its routing gate. See [cycle-engine.md](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#synthesis-outer-loop) for the full algorithm, provenance tracking, claim queue, and file assembly contract.

## Stop Conditions

Autoprove checks stop budgets at cycle boundaries via `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/cycle_tracker.sh tick --stuck=yes|no`.
Limits are checked at cycle boundaries only — a long-running tool call within a cycle
will not be interrupted.

Autoprove stops when the **first** of these is satisfied:

1. **Completion** — all sorries in scope are filled
2. **Max stuck cycles** — `--max-stuck-cycles` consecutive stuck cycles (default: 3). Session-enforced via `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/cycle_tracker.sh`.
3. **Max cycles** — `--max-cycles` total cycles reached (default: 20). Session-enforced via `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/cycle_tracker.sh`.
4. **Max runtime** — best-effort wall-clock budget reached (`--max-total-runtime`, default: 120m). Checked at cycle boundaries and deep preflight.
5. **Manual user stop** — user interrupts
6. **Queue empty** — all claims attempted; expected completion for `--formalize=auto` sessions

See [Session Tracking](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#session-tracking) for the cycle boundary protocol and enforcement levels.

## Structured Summary on Stop

When autoprove stops (for any reason), emit:

```
## Autoprove Summary

**Reason stopped:** [completion | max-stuck | max-cycles | max-runtime | user-stop | queue-empty]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sorries before | N |
| Sorries after | M |
| Cycles run | C |
| Stuck cycles | S |
| Deep invocations | D |
| Time elapsed | T |
| Formalizations | F |

**Handoff recommendations:**
- [If incomplete: "Run /lean4:prove for guided work on remaining N sorries"]
- [If stuck: "Review stuck blockers: file:line, file:line"]
- [If clean: "All sorries filled. Run /lean4:checkpoint to save."]
- [If claims remaining: "N claims remaining in queue. Re-run with same --source and --formalize-out to continue (existing claims detected via target file)."]
```

## Deep Mode

Bounded subroutine for stubborn sorries. Default: `stuck` (auto-escalate when stuck).

Modes: `never` | `stuck` (default, auto on stuck) | `always` (auto on any failure). Note: `ask` is coerced to `stuck` (no interactive prompting in autoprove).

Statement changes are NOT permitted. Declaration headers are immutable (header fence). If deep concludes the statement is wrong, emit `next_action = redraft`, auto-revert any header changes, and mark stuck. When `--formalize` is active, statement work is handled by the outer loop's redraft path, not by deep mode.

**Safety:** Deep creates a path-scoped pre-deep snapshot, enforces scope/diff budgets, and auto-rolls back on regression. Rollback marks the sorry as stuck with reason.

**Deep safety coercions** (validated and applied at startup with warnings):
- `--deep-rollback=never` → coerced to `on-regression`
- `--deep-regression-gate=off` → coerced to `strict`

When dispatching sorry-filler-deep, include pre-collected MCP context per [cycle-engine.md § Pre-flight Context](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#pre-flight-context-for-subagent-dispatch).

See [cycle-engine.md](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#deep-mode) for full semantics, definitions, and prove/autoprove comparison.

### Header Fence

Declaration headers (everything from `theorem`/`def`/`lemma` through `:= by`) are snapshotted at deep entry. At each checkpoint, the engine compares headers against the snapshot. Any header change triggers immediate rollback and marks the sorry as stuck with `"deep: header fence — declaration header modified"`.

## Stuck Definition

A sorry is **stuck** when: same failure 2-3x, same build error 2x, no progress 10+ min, or empty LSP search 2x.

**When stuck:** auto-review → planner mode → revised plan → next cycle executes plan. On falsification flag: auto counterexample/salvage pass. Handoff must include LSP queries attempted, top candidates, and `lean_multi_attempt` outcomes.

See [cycle-engine.md](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#stuck-definition) for full detection logic and blocker signature computation.

## Falsification Artifacts

When a statement is disproved, create `T_counterexample` and `T_salvaged` lemmas. Avoid proving `¬ P` if original sorry exists.

See [cycle-engine.md](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#falsification-artifacts) for Lean code templates.

## Repair Mode

Compiler-guided repair is **escalation-only** — not the default response to a first failure. Auto-invoke only when compiler errors are the active blocker: same blocker 2x, same build error 2x, or 3+ errors in scope. Apply direct fixes first. Budgets: max 2 per error signature, max 8 total per cycle. No improvement after 2 attempts → stuck + review + replan. Interactive repair options are coerced to autonomous (auto-select next strategy).

When dispatching proof-repair, include pre-collected MCP context per [cycle-engine.md § Pre-flight Context](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#pre-flight-context-for-subagent-dispatch).

See [cycle-engine.md](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#repair-mode) for full policy and [compilation-errors.md](../skills/lean4/references/compilation-errors.md) for error-specific fixes.

## Safety

Guardrailed git commands are blocked. See [cycle-engine.md](../skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md#safety) for the full list.
- **Line width.** Follow mathlib 100-char line width — do not wrap lines at 80 when they fit within 100.
